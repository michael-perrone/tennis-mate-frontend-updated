        <p>
          We notice you haven't created a profile before. We recommend all of
          our instructors create a profile. It creates an easy way for customers
          at tennis clubs to find an instructor with an experience and coaching
          ability to their liking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Making a profile is not required for anyone. Check with your club if
          they want you to make a profile before you decide to skip this step.
          If you decide you want to make a profile later on or accidentally skip
          this page, don't worry, you can always create and update your profile
          later on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating your profile is easy, you just need to answer a few questions
          about yourself and you can upload a photo as well if you would like.
          Also writing a small bio about yourself can really go a long way with
          customers. It makes getting started with someone new much easier.
          Remember, creating a profile is not required, but it is reccomended.
